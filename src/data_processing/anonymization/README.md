# Anonymization Pipeline

## Description
The anonymization process is implemented to prevent the exposure of confidential information in the datasets. This is crucial for ensuring that sensitive details such as personal names, identification numbers, and phone numbers do not become part of the training data and, subsequently, the output generated by the language models.

## How to use
